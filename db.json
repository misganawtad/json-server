No acknowledgment of the effort I put in, just a detailed list of everything they didn’t like. It’s like nothing I do is ever good enough.\n\nThen there was the meeting. I could feel the tension as soon as I walked in. My coworker, Sarah, threw me under the bus in front of the entire team, blaming me for the delay in a project we were both responsible for. I didn’t say anything—I should have stood up for myself—but I just sat there, swallowing my frustration, feeling smaller with every word she said.\n\nThe cherry on top? I overheard two colleagues whispering about me in the break room. Something about how I \"don’t pull my weight.\" If only they knew how much I stay late, how much I stress over getting everything perfect. But I guess none of that matters when you’re the easy target.\n\nBy the time I got home, I felt drained—emotionally, physically, mentally.

Having had MD for years and suffered from the terrible pain of total depression the fact I KNOW that Im dying right this moment doesnt mean in reality that I will. But my Mind tells me that death is a step away and that there is nothing to do but pray that I will die with some kind of dignity. You will never read about this total despair in any books about MD. Over the past days I have read books on MD and they talk about depression in a clinical and matter of fact way but no one describes the TOTAL and COMPLETE feelings of despair and sorrow that depression causes. Tonight as I write I feel totally alone, total despair, and there is no one to reach out to comfort me. That is how many sufferers feel. We can be in a crowded room, or with relatives yet feel totally alone, isolated in the prison called MD. Today I will see my Health Worker and I will tell him that I feel near to death and feel total hatred towards myself. I will tell him that I desperately need treatment, help and support. I know that after I have told him these things that I will walk away alone, knowing that like a million times before he will not be able to help me. Here in England the fact that I am talking about MD and have not hurt myself in anyway goes against me. To receive help I have to be one stage ahead, I must of hurt myself before I receive any kind of treatment. What could the medical services do for me anyway? There is nothing really. Tonight no one can help me. The world within my mind is a dark and frightening place, a place where I fear my own thoughts, fear that I will continue to live, fear that I will die. What is this feeling of death within my mind? It is so real so powerful. Just as I know that I am writing in my diary, I know that at this moment I am going to die. I am totally aware of every part of my body, I feel bombarded with thoughts that I feel are not my own. I feel trapped in my mind, trapped with a monster within that has no mercy, no feelings for me. Where do sufferers like myself go for support at 3am in the morning? As I write the world is asleep, the world has no thought for sufferers like me. I reach out but there is no one, only myself. Perhaps I am my best friend, it sounds silly, but maybe if I make friends with myself and not see myself as my own enemy, perhaps then I will survive, perhaps then I will be able to comfort myself. This is MD, a fragmented human being that sees even himself as his own worst enemy. I will pray for all sufferers of despair tonight that we will somehow reach out to ourselves and feel comfort and peace.",

      "userText": "Dear Diary. Over the past months there has been a war-taking place within my mind. My illness, Manic Depression has tried to destroy me, but through it all I have kept myself safe from this Monster within my mind. At times I have suffered the most extreme depression where I have felt totally out of control, and during this time MD has never missed an opportunity to confuse or destroy me. I have come so near to killing myself, actually making plans to die, but somehow I have held onto life and survived. Today I cannot say that I am totally well, the MD Monster is always there waiting for a moment of weakness. But I have learned ways to cope, learned ways to survive. The depression part of MD is for me the most dangerous part of the MD cycle. I recall passing a point of depression where I actually lost sight of reality. It was the most frightening experience of my life. Billions of thoughts invaded my mind and I felt that each thought was not my own and trying to destroy me. At times I lay in bed not having the energy to do anything. Every moment I wanted to die and I prayed more then anything that someone would save me from myself, save me from destruction. I wanted to go into hospital and wished above anything else that I could close my eyes and sleep forever. I remember doctors calling to see me asking if I wanted to go into hospital, but I never gave in. I continued to fight for my life fight to survive. My worse enemy became myself. At times panic, fears, phobias, crashed into my mind. I remember staying awake for days to frightened to sleep. I walked the streets at 3am in the morning thinking of ways to kill myself. My own mind turned in on itself and wanted to die. I felt that I was an observer of my thoughts, watching my mind slowly die from a distance. Can there ever be an end to this sadness and destruction within? I do not think so. MD is part of me, it is part of my mind, and I know that for as long as I live I will experience this destruction and sadness. Maybe I will survive, maybe I will die by my own hand. But whatever happens in the future my creator will know my efforts to survive. I believe that in my moment of despair someone is protecting me, keeping me safe, and I pray tonight that I will be kept safe from my mind in the days to come.",
